Soy protein is a known allergen. Persons who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to soy protein run the risk of possible allergic reactions if they consume this product. The product being recalled is 15-ounce cans of ""Chef BOYARDEE 99% Fat Free CHEESE Ravioli in Tomato Sauce,"" which actually contain 15-ounces of beef ravioli. The bottom of each can bears the establishment code ""794,"" followed by the case code ""J17101 RF."" The ravioli was produced on Oct. 17, 2001 and distributed to retail establishments nationwide. The product was also exported to Haiti, Guatemala and Bermuda. ""We urge consumers, especially those allergic or sensitive to soy, to check their cupboards and pantries,"" said Margaret OK. Glavin, acting FSIS administrator. ""If they find the product listed above, consumers should not eat it, but return it to the point of purchase."" ConAgra identified the labeling problem after customers notified the company of the mislabeling. Consumers with questions about the recall may contact ConAgras consumer hotline at (800) 414-2500. Media with questions may contact Kay Carpenter, Corporate Communications, at (949) 437-1144. Consumers with food safety questions can phone the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at l-800-535-4555. The hotline can be reached from l0 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday, and recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. # NOTE: Access news releases and other information at the FSIS Web site at http://www.fsis.usda.gov FOOD ALLERGIES Consumers who have a food allergy or severe food sensitivity should always read ingredient labels. In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food. A food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. Symptoms may include throat swelling, trouble breathing, or a rash. Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.

33,2004,3,19,na,Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water,"Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water Friday 19 March 2004 Category D: For information only Ref: 12/2004 Heads of Environmental Health Services and Directors of Trading Standards will wish to be aware of a product withdrawal by The Coca-Cola Company of their Dasani brand bottled still water. The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate, which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is: All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agency's web statement and Q&A regarding Dasani water attached below. The Coca-Cola Company has issued a press statement (see attached). In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company, the number for which is: 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the Coca-Cola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11.45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers, Coca-Cola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday, 19 March 2004, and will be 80-85 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK, including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium, we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis, we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride, a derivate of bromide, bromate, was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue, we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs. We are working closely with all our stockists to remove the product from the marketplace. This withdrawal only affects Dasani in the UK market. Our consumers rightly expect that our products meet only the highest possible standards for quality as well as all UK regulations.

The product labels do not specifically state that egg white lysozyme, an allergen, is an ingredient. The following products are subject to recall: 24-ounce bags of BERTOLLI, MEATBALLS POMODORO & PENNE with peppers and onions in a tomato basil sauce, Complete Skillet Meal for Two. Each label includes the establishment number, EST. 21340 inside the USDA mark of inspection.

Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. Several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat. Persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.

67,2009,5,17,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america announces voluntary nationwide recall of peanut butter,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (January 13, 2009) – Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. All product affected was produced on or after July 1, 2008, specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below. The peanut butter being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnell’s Pride to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing. None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores. “We deeply regret that this has happened,” said Stewart Parnell, owner and president of PCA. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.” PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA. According to the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states. The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions. PCA is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation. According to a CDC update issued on their website today (January 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. The CDC and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. To date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores. Customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. Customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information. Eating food contaminated with Salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. Most people infected with Salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses.

71,2010,1,15,us,New York Firm Recalls Beef Carcass That Contains Prohibited Materials,"WASHINGTON, January 15, 2010 - Jerry Hayes Meats Inc., a Newark Valley, N.Y., establishment is recalling approximately 490 pounds of a beef carcass that may not have had the spinal column removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of spinal cord and vertebral column from cattle over 30 months of age, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material (SRM) and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with FSIS regulations. SRMs are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. Therefore, FSIS prohibits SRMs from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the BSE agent. The products subject to recall include: 1- ""BEEF CARCASS,"" which bears the establishment number ""EST. 04488 M"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was packed on January 7, 2010, and sold to a single customer in New York. The problem was discovered through routine FSIS inspection activities. FSIS has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

73,2010,8,6,us,California Firm Recalls Frozen Ground Beef Products Due To Possible E. Coli O157: H7 Contamination,"WASHINGTON, August 6, 2010 - Valley Meat Company, a Modesto, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately one million pounds of frozen ground beef patties and bulk ground beef products that may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. FSIS became aware of the problem on July 15 when the agency was notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of a small E. coli O157:H7 cluster of illnesses with a rare strain as determined by PFGE subtyping. A total of six patients with illness onset dates between April 8 and June 18, 2010 were reported at that time. After further review, CDPH added another patient from February to the case count, bringing the count to seven. FSIS is continuing to work with the CDPH and the company on the investigation. Anyone with signs or symptoms of foodborne illness should contact a health care provider. PREPARING GROUND BEEF FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHOTLINE or visit www.fsis.usda.gov Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° F. Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as E. coli O157:H7. The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

FSIS and the establishment are concerned that some product may still be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product that is the subject of this recall. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of a recall and that steps are taken to make certain that a suspect product is no longer available to consumers. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

74,2010,8,19,us,2010 - NuCal Foods Conducts Recall of Shell Eggs Supplied from Wright County Egg Because of Possible Health Risk,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - Ripon, California - August 17, 2010 - The following statement was released by officials of NuCal Foods of Ripon, California regarding the voluntary recall of shell eggs supplied from Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa. NuCal Foods is voluntarily recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

The salads contain eggs that are the subject of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recall due to concerns about contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels] 10-oz. plastic containers of ""Fresh Garden Highway Spinach Salad with Bacon"" 10.75-oz plastic containers of ""Fresh Garden Highway Cobb Salad"" Recommendations for people at risk for Listeriosis Wash hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw meat and poultry for at least 20 seconds. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, bologna or other deli meats unless reheated until steaming hot. Do not eat refrigerated paté, meat spreads from a meat counter or smoked seafood found in the refrigerated section of the store. Foods that don't need refrigeration, like canned tuna and canned salmon, are safe to eat. Refrigerate after opening. Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk and do not eat foods that have unpasteurized milk in them. Do not eat salads made in the store such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad or seafood salad.

Use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature of your refrigerator. The products subject to recall have a ""Sell By"" date through 2/8/2012, and bear the establishment number ""Est. 39897"" as well as the USDA mark of inspection The products were distributed to a warehouse in Pennsylvania for further distribution to retail locations. The problem was discovered when F&S Produce Company Inc . was notified by one of its suppliers that hard-cooked eggs (a product inspected by the FDA) had tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, and are being recalled by Michael Foods Egg Products Co. The salads contain the recalled eggs and are the subject of this FSIS recall. FSIS, FDA, and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: www.fsis.usda.gov/ FSIS_Recalls/ Open_Federal_Cases/ index.asp . Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis. However, listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea.

97,2012,7,22,us,Pennsylvania Firm Recalls Ground Beef Products Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, July 22, 2012 - Cargill Meat Solutions, a Wyalusing, Pa., establishment, is recalling 29,339 pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products subject to recall, sold wholesale and for further processing: 14 pound chub packages of ""Grnd Beef Fine 85/15"", packed 3 chubs to approximate 42-pound cases. The products subject to recall bears the establishment number ""EST. 9400"" inside the USDA mark of inspection. While the use-by date has passed and these products are no longer available for retail sale, FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen in consumers' freezers. These products were produced on May 25, 2012, and were shipped to distribution centers in Connecticut, Maine and New York for further distribution. Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods. Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. The safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160° F, and 165° F for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking. It is important to note that the above listed products were repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on FSIS' website at: www.fsis.usda.gov/ FSIS_Recalls/ Open_Federal_Cases/ index.asp . FSIS became aware of the problem during the course of an ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA, VT-preliminary data, subject to change). Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vermont Department of Health, New York State Department of Health, and New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, FSIS was able to link illnesses in five case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. Illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from June 6, 2012 to June 13, 2012. Two of the five case-patients were hospitalized. Leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the Vermont Department of Health tested positive for Salmonella Enteritidis with the outbreak strain. This outbreak strain of Salmonella Enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC and public health partners on the investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. The most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Consumers who have questions are encouraged to call the company's consumer information line at (888) 812-1646.

100,2012,10,10,us,"2012 - Dean Foods Company of California and Meadow Gold Dairy Conduct Voluntary Recall of Two Albertsons Brand Ice Cream Varieties - Peanut Butter Cup and Peanut Butter Chocolate in 1.5 Quarts Sizes - Due to Potential Health Risk Posed by Nationwide Sunland, Inc. Peanut Butter","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – October 10, 2012 – The Dean Foods Company of California processing facility in Buena Park, Calif., and Meadow Gold Dairy processing facility in Orem, Utah, are taking the precautionary measure to voluntarily recall two ice cream varieties manufactured for Albertsons supermarkets. This recall was initiated because the affected products contain a peanut butter ingredient supplied by Sunland, Inc. which may be contaminated with Salmonella. The peanut butter manufacturer Sunland recently expanded its nationwide product recall. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. To date, no complaints or reactions have been reported related to these ice cream products, and only two flavors of Albertsons ice cream are included in the recall. No Meadow Gold® brand ice cream products are included in this recall. Both the “Peanut Butter Cup” and “Peanut Butter Chocolate” flavors are sold in 1.5 quarts (1.42L) cardboard cartons in Albertsons stores. Only the ice cream made in two plants is impacted by this recall and therefore the product being recalled was sold between 3/26/2010 and 9/25/2012 only in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington. The ice cream is printed with one of two plant codes: either 49-11 or 06-20 and a “BEST BY” or “EXP” date ranging from 3/26/2011 to 9/25/2013. No other Albertsons or Meadow Gold brand ice cream products are affected by this recall. In particular, this recall only impacts Albertsons ice cream products with the plant codes of 49-11 or 06-20 and sold in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington. The processing facilities have ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product package to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the Company at 1-800-587-2259 between 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

110,2013,2,11,us,2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company Announces Voluntary Recall of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - February 8, 2013 - Nestlé Prepared Foods Company today announced the voluntary recall of two production codes of LEAN CUISINE® Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358. The production codes are 2311587812 and 2312587812; the “best before date” appears as DEC 2013. The voluntary recall is limited to these two days of production, which were distributed nationwide. No other production dates, sizes or varieties of LEAN CUISINE products are affected by this recall. The reason for the recall is that the meal may contain fragments of glass. Nestlé is taking this action after three consumers reported they had found small fragments of glass in the ravioli portion of the entrée. No injuries were reported by any of the consumers. The entrée being recalled was produced during early November, 2012. Due to its popularity, Nestlé believes very little remains in retail distribution. For this reason, Nestlé is reaching out to consumers to ask that they examine their freezer inventory for specific packages of LEAN CUISINE®, Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli, UPC 13800-58358 with production codes 2311587812 and 2312587812 and a “best before date” which appears as DEC 2013. To locate the production code, consumers should look for the gray “proof of purchase” panel, located on the right end flap of the package, below the ingredient statement. Consumers who may have purchased the recalled LEAN CUISINE item should not consume the product, but instead should contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (866) 586-9424 or leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions.

Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause Listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. Listeriosis can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths.

People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Products were distributed to the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Alabama. A routine sample of Asadero cheese, taken by an inspector from the Michigan Department of Agriculture’s Food and Dairy Division on February 23, 2009, was subsequently tested by the Michigan Department of Agriculture Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The recalled Asadero and Oaxaca cheese products were distributed to retails stores and delis in 10 lb balls, 16- and 12 oz plastic packages, sold under the name ""Aguas Calientes"".

120,2013,7,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america provides additional information about expanded nationwide recall of peanut products,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lynchburg, Va. (February 8, 2009) -- In connection with the January 28, 2009 expanded recall announcement issued by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products. On January 28, 2009, PCA announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its Blakely, Georgia facility since January 1, 2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis and arthritis. For more information on Salmonella, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Website at http://www.cdc.gov. PCA has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. However, because the January 28th recall notice indicated that PCA does not sell products directly to consumers in stores, and because the expanded recall includes PCA products made since the beginning of 2007, the potential for confusion may exist. Therefore, the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. These products were part of the January 28th recall, but here, they are individually listed. Consumers should be aware that the list below includes only PCA's own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. The list does not include brands made by PCA for other firms. FDA continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls. PCA sold its Casey’s, Parnell’s Pride, Reggie, and Robinson Crusoe labels to 99 Cent Stuff, 99 Cents Only Stores, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree Stores.

131,2013,10,12,us,California Wholesale Store Recalls Rotisserie Chicken Products Due to Possible Salmonella Heidelberg Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12, 2013 – Costco’s El Camino Real store in South San Francisco, Calif., is recalling 9,043 units (approximately 39,755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of Salmonella Heidelberg, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products subject to recall are: 8,730 “Kirkland Signature Foster Farms” rotisserie chickens 313 total units of “Kirkland Farm” rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad The products were sold directly to consumers in a Costco located at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, Calif., between Sept. 11 and Sep. 23, 2013. This recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the Costco El Camino Real store. The PFGE pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the United States. FSIS, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the County of San Mateo Public Health Department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the Costco El Camino Real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with CDC, public health partners in California and Costco on the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it becomes available. This group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of Salmonella Heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. For more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts. Consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact Costco at (800) 774-2678. FSIS reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces. FSIS further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °F internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °F must be reached for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer. All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° F as determined by a food thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with HIV or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. # Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis: Wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. The mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces. Additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. For more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing. If soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses. Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. Thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º F for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º F for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F). Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.","product: rotisserie chicken and chicken products (meat/poultry) hazard: salmonella heidelberg contamination (foodborne

133,2014,3,7,us,Arkansas Firm Recalls Chicken Products Due To Misbranding and Undeclared Allergen,"WASHINGTON, March 7, 2014 – George’s Inc., a Springdale, Ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 29,200 pounds of seasoned raw, chicken breast strips due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The products are formulated with soy protein, a known allergen, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). However, the product was released with a label for George’s boneless skinless breast pieces with rib meat, which does not declare soy or MSG on the label. The products subject to recall bear the label: 40 lb. bulk cartons of “GEORGE’S BONELESS SKINLESS BREAST PIECES W/RIB MEAT” with case code 4790. The products were produced and packaged from Dec. 21 through Dec. 23, 2013, and were sold to distributors in Tennessee and Iowa for further distribution. The recalled products bear the establishment number “P-13584” below the USDA Mark of Inspection and “Packed on” date in the format of “mm/dd/yy” on the carton label. The problem was discovered after the company received a customer complaint of incorrectly labeled product. The customer noticed that the product they received appeared to be seasoned, when it was labeled as being simply boneless, skinless breast pieces. The company’s investigation found that the mislabeling occurred when the George’s label was mistakenly applied to allergen containing products packaged nearby. FSIS and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Consumers with questions about the recall should contact Ali Perry at (479) 927-7256.

This means the product is a possible health risk to anyone with an allergy to peanut. Product name: Lovemore Iced Rich Fruit Cake 'Best before' end: 15 May 2015 Batch code: 020914 Allergen: peanut If you have bought the above product and have an allergy to peanut, do not eat it. Instead, return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. The company has recalled the product from sale and has contacted its retail customers. The company has been informed that it should contact the relevant allergy support organisations, which will inform their at-risk members of the issue. The company will be circulating a point-of-sale notice to its retail customers so these can be displayed in stores that sell the affected product. No other Lovemore products are known to be affected. Sometimes there will be a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold.

161,2015,3,7,us,rio tex wholesale meats recalls ready-to-eat beef products due to possible listeria contamination,"WASHINGTON, March 6, 2015 – Rio Tex Wholesale Meats, a Mercedes, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The beef products were produced on various dates between March 25, 2014 and February 19, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)] 20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods COOKED BEEF TACO FILLING.” 20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods SEASONED COOKED BEEF BARBACOA.” 20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods FULLY COOKED BARBACOA.” 20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “Hausman Foods BEEF CARNE GUISADA.” 15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “Rio-Tex-Meats BARBACOA.” The products subject to recall bear the establishment number “EST. 13545” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in Texas. The problem was discovered when FSIS personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple Listeria monocytogenes positives. The historical sampling showed a recurrence of Lm isolates with indistinguishable Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. The presence of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with Lm. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. FSIS advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Barney Trevino, Plant Manager, at (956) 565-1142.

172,2015,8,13,us,Kapowsin Meats Recalls Pork Product Due To Possible Salmonella Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 13, 2015 – Kapowsin Meats, a Graham, Wash. establishment, is recalling approximately 116,262 pounds of whole hogs that may be contaminated with Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-,the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The whole hogs for barbeque item were produced on various dates between April 18, 2015 and July 27, 2015. The following products are subject to recall: Varying weights of Whole Hogs for Barbeque The product subject to recall bears the establishment number “Est. 1628” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The product was shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in Alaska and Washington. On July 15, 2015, the Washington State Department of Health notified FSIS of an investigation of Salmonella I4,[5],12:i:-illnesses. Working in conjunction with the Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FSIS determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from Kapowsin Meats and these illnesses. Traceback investigation has identified 32 case-patients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. These illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. Based on epidemiological evidence, 134 case-patients have been identified in Washington with illness onset dates ranging from April 25, 2015 to July 29, 2015. FSIS continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° F with a three minute rest time. The only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ. For whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in several places. Check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. Remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact John Anderson, Owner, at (253) 847-1777.

187,2016,2,5,us,TF Foods Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Peanuts in Fried Bean Snack (Na-Pia-Jo),"TF Foods of Paramount, CA is recalling its 10.60 ounce packages of ""Fried Bean Snack (Na-Pia-Jo)"" food treats because they may contain undeclared peanuts. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recalled ""Fried Bean Snack (Na-Pia-Jo)"" were distributed nationally in retail stores between November of 2015 and beginning of February of 2016. The product comes in a 10.60 ounce, clear plastic bag. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

Healthy persons infected with Salmonella can experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The products were distributed to food service and retail stores throughout Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and West Virginia. Products were distributed under the following brand names: Blue Goose Market, Hollywood Market, Market Fresh Fine Foods, Roger's Foodland, Marv & Alison's Marketplace, Long Lake Market, Martin's, Holiday Market, The Purple Onion, Trentwood Farms, Angeli Foods, Market Square, Village Food Market, Martha's Vineyard, Remke Market or as generic product without branding.

211,2016,6,13,us,Kellogg Company Voluntarily Recalls Certain Snacks for Potential Undeclared Peanut Residue Due to Flour Supplier Recall,"BATTLE CREEK, Mich. – Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) today announced that it is voluntarily recalling certain varieties and limited dates of production of Mother's®, Keebler®, Kellogg's® Special K® brownies, Murray® and Famous Amos® snacks and cookies because they may contain undeclared peanut residue.

While consumers with severe peanut allergies should avoid the recalled products, the FDA has stated that the amount of peanut exposure from the flour is low and not expected to cause adverse health effects in the vast majority of peanut allergic consumers. The company has received no reports of related illness to date and is taking this action out of an abundance of caution. HOW TO IDENTIFY THE RECALLED PRODUCT The following products were distributed throughout the United States and Puerto Rico: Images of these products can be found at www.Kelloggs.com/FlourRecall.

An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics.

The frozen, heat treated, not ready-to-eat (NRTE) chicken tenderloin items were produced on Jan. 25, 2016. The following products are subject to recall: [View Labels (PDF Only)] 30-lb. net-weight case containing six, 5-lb. bags in clear film of “Simmons UNCOOKED CHICKEN TENDERLOIN FRITTERS,” with a case code 31473, packaging date code of 6025, and a Use-By date of 01/25/17. 30-lb. net-weight case containing six, 5-lb. bags in clear film of “Simmons UNCOOKED CHICKEN BREAST TENDERLOIN FRITTERS,” with a case code 62331 and a packaging date of 6025. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-5837” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were distributed to Arkansas for institutional use. The problem was discovered on July 7, 2016, when Simmons Prepared Foods, Inc. received notice from a supplier that flour sold to the establishment was recalled by General Mills. The firm used the recalled flour to bread the chicken fritters affected by this recall action. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to consumption of these Simmons Prepared Foods, Inc. products. Information on the General Mills’ recall can be found at:http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm509693.htm. Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O121 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O121 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

corn dog products that could potentially be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. the firm has not received test results for listeria monocytogenes in connection with the recalled products, but due to recurring listeria species issues at the firm, it has decided to remove the products from commerce as a precautionary measure. there have been no confirmed reports of illnesses or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify

Colonial Heights, VA - Sabra Dipping Co., LLC is voluntarily recalling certain hummus products made prior to November 8, 2016 due to concerns over Listeria monocytogenes, which was identified at the manufacturing facility but not in tested finished product. The recall includes the products listed below; these were distributed to retail outlets, including food service accounts and supermarkets, in the U.S. and Canada. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The company is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution. Consumers with any product with a “Best Before” date up through January 23, 2017 are urged to discard it. Consumers can find code and “Best Before” date on the lid of each package. * The Sabra Party Platter Selects contains sealed and capped containers of Sabra Classic Hummus 7oz; cheese and Genoa Salame sliced at Daniele International, Inc; and pre-packaged breadsticks. The Genoa Salame is a USDA regulated product; the Party Tray includes the USDA mark of inspection next to the salami packaged in the tray and “EST. 9992” next to the pre-packaged breadsticks in the tray. These Party Trays are subject to recall; the entire contents of the Party Tray should not be consumed due to the potential for cross contamination of other tray components with the recalled hummus through consumer handling. No other Sabra products are affected. In particular, Sabra products not included in the recall are: Sabra Organic Hummus, Sabra Salsa, Sabra Guacamole and Sabra Greek Yogurt Dips.

240,2016,12,17,us,Williams-Sonoma Announces the Voluntary Recall of Meyer Lemon Poppy Quick Bread,"Williams-Sonoma of San Francisco, CA is voluntarily recalling limited quantities of WILLIAMS-SONOMA MEYER LEMON POPPY SEED QUICK BREAD, as it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella. The ingredient supplier has issued a recall of the bulk milk powder. Although no pathogenic bacteria have been found in the powdered milk product supplied in Williams-Sonoma’s product, we have decided out of an abundance of caution to recall the product produced from the specific lot received from our ingredient supplier. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

(SCI), a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM), is recalling a specific lot of dry roasted almonds because they may contain undeclared cashews. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to cashews run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the cashew-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of cashews. The recalled dry roasted almonds were distributed between December 22, 2016, and January 19, 2017, to three customers, one of whom redistributed them for sale in either bulk bins or clam shells to retail outlets in California, including Safeway and Nugget Markets. Representatives of SCI are working with DSD Merchandisers Inc., the distribution customer, and these outlets to ensure the product is removed from shelves and returned. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this issue. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by a temporary process irregularity that occurred at the third-party contract manufacturer that processed and packaged the almonds for SCI. Then, an inventory processing irregularity resulted in the almonds being forwarded to the impacted customers.

Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in the newborns. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up with the importer concerned. The importer confirmed that about 39 kilograms of the above-mentioned products have been imported to Hong Kong and were only supplied to city'super supermarket for sale. - The supermarket concerned has already stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected products. - The CFS will continue to closely monitor the situation and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health.

An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased this product are urged not to consume it.

Recalls Ready-To-Eat Ham Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, April 25, 2017 – Fineberg Packing Co., Inc., a Memphis, Tenn. establishment, is recalling approximately 8,822 pounds of ready-to-eat ham products that may be adulterated withListeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The ready-to-eat hickory smoked and BBQ ham items were packaged on January 16, 2017. The following products are subject to recall:[View Labels (PDF Only)] 14-lb. vacuum-sealed packages containing “FINEBERG’S Finest Danish Brand BBQ Flavored Ham” with Sell by date 03/26/2017 and case code 17016. 30.6-lb. boxes containing 2 vacuum-sealed packages of “Holly Brand hickory smoked fully cooked HAM” with case code 17016. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 428” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. The problem was discovered during a Food Safety Assessment conducted by an FSIS employee. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F.

266,2017,5,11,us,"Kabob's Acquisition, Inc. Recalls Meat and Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination","WASHINGTON, May 10, 2017 – Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc., a Lake City, Ga. establishment, is recalling approximately 5,946 pounds of turkey and ham sandwich products which included a non-meat ingredient that was recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The Monte Cristo (turkey, ham, cheese, on French toast) sandwiches were produced from May 1, 2014 through February 1, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF Only)] 13.25-lb. bulk cases containing 200 “Kabobs MONTE CRISTO TURKEY BREAST, HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH” in shrink wrapped plastic trays and bearing case codes: PM14E27, PM14H14, PM14J10, PM14E01, PM14E12, PM14E13, PM15C26, PM15E06, PM15G23, PM14L18, PM15A08, PM15C26, PM15K20, PM16B08, PM16B09, PM16F22, PM16F24, and PM17B01. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-6640” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional locations in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas. The problem was discovered when Kabob’s Acquisition, Inc., was notified by their French toast ingredient supplier, that the French toast used in the sandwich products was recalled due to potential Lm contamination. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Jonathan Herrera, Consumer Marketing Manager, at (678) 553-1245.

This additional information was identified during the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) food safety investigation. Pâtisserie Jessica is recalling par Sophie! brand Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake from the marketplace due to norovirus. Consumers should not consume the recalled product described below. Recalled products Brand Name Common Name Size Code(s) on Product UPC par Sophie! Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Cake 650 g 17185 8 10175 00926 1 What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor. Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

The products contain fish (anchovies), a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.

335,2018,7,25,us,AMPI Recalls Limited Amount of Dry Whey Powder Because of Possible Health Risk,"Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) of New Ulm, Minn., is recalling dry whey powder packaged in 50-pound and 25-kg bags that were produced at the cooperative’s Blair, Wis., dry whey plant from May 1-5, 2018; May 24-29, 2018; June 2-5, 2018; and June 7-14, 2018 due to the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. This is a precautionary recall. All products shipped to the marketplace tested negative for salmonella. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. The products included in the recall can be identified by the following lot numbers, which can be found printed along the top of the bag. Images of the bags can be found below. AMPI dry whey powder is not sold directly to consumers, but is used as an ingredient in a number of foods. It is sold directly to manufacturers and also distributed by brokers. A limited amount was sold for animal feed. All products shipped into the marketplace tested negative for salmonella as part of AMPI’s routine testing program. However, because additional product tested positive for salmonella under AMPI’s routine test and hold procedures, the company is recalling product as a precautionary measure. AMPI has ceased production at its Blair, Wis., dry whey plant, is currently investigating the cause for the positive samples, and will take all necessary remedial actions. All customers that have received the dry whey powder lots have been notified by AMPI and instructed to return the recalled powder, or to document the destruction of the powder, after contacting AMPI for specific instructions. At AMPI, we are dedicated to producing dairy products that meet the highest quality and safety standards required by our customers as well as complying with all government food safety requirements. We are recalling this product as a precautionary measure and in keeping with our commitment to the best interests of our customers and consumers, and in line with the Food Safety Modernization Act and FDA requirements.

Recalls Raw Beef Products due to Possible Salmonella Newport Contamination","EDITOR’S NOTE: Editor’s note: This release is being reissued as an expansion of the Oct. 4, 2018 recall. The scope of this recall expansion now includes an additional 5,156,076 pounds of raw beef products, which were produced and packed from July 26, 2018 to Sept. 7, 2018.

Editor’s Note: FSIS and our public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health officials, are investigating a Salmonella Newport outbreak. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this widespread outbreak, and additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Salmonella is prevalent and can be present in raw poultry and meat – no raw poultry or meat is sterile. In addition to discarding the product associated with this recall, consumers can protect themselves now and in the future by ALWAYS cooking their raw meat to a safe internal temperature, which is measured by using a food thermometer. The cooking process kills the Salmonella. No one should be eating partially cooked or raw meat. Additionally, it is essential that people wash their hands after handling raw poultry, meat, and pet food to avoid cross contamination. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, 2018 – JBS Tolleson, Inc., a Tolleson, Ariz. establishment, is recalling approximately 12,093,271 pounds of non-intact raw beef products that may be contaminated with Salmonella Newport, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-7345” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutional and retail locations nationwide. FSIS and public health partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Schwarzengrund illnesses involving 5 case patients from 2 states. Wisconsin collected three intact Butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where 4 of the case patients live. The case patients and ground turkey Salmonella Schwarzengrund isolates are closely related, genetically. Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

372,2019,3,23,us,Henry Avocado Recalls Whole Avocados Because Of Possible Health Risk,"Henry Avocado Corporation is voluntarily recalling California-grown whole avocados sold in bulk at retail stores because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Henry Avocado is issuing this voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution due to positive test results on environmental samples taken during a routine government inspection at its California packing facility. There are no reported illnesses associated with this recall. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The recalled products – California-grown conventional and organic avocados -- were packed at Henry Avocado’s packing facility in California and distributed in Arizona, California, Florida New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin. All shipments from the packing facility are subject to the recall (Henry Avocado did not begin packing there until late January 2019). Avocados imported from Mexico and distributed by Henry Avocado are not subject to the recall and may continue to be sold and consumed. Henry Avocado is contacting all affected customers to confirm that the recalled products are immediately removed from store shelves. For conventional products purchased at retail, consumers can identify the recalled products by the “Bravocado” stickers. Henry Avocado organic products do not carry the “Bravocado” label on the sticker. Instead those products are labeled “organic” and include “California” on the sticker. Retailers can identify Henry Avocado organic products by the bar code on the stickers. Consumers who have purchased any recalled avocados are urged not to consume them, but to discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with further questions may contact Henry Avocado at (760) 745-6632, Ext 132 or visit www.henryavocado.com/media Henry Avocado Corporation is fully cooperating with federal and California health officials to facilitate an efficient and complete recall of these avocados. “We are voluntarily recalling our products and taking every action possible to ensure the safety of consumers who eat our avocados,” says Phil Henry, President of Henry Avocado.","product: avocados (fruits) hazard: possible contamination with listeria monocytogenes (microbial contamination).henry avocado recalls whole avocados because of possible health riskhenry avocado corporation is voluntarily recalling california-grown whole avocados sold in bulk at retail stores because they have the potential to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. henry avocado is issuing this voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution due to positive test results on environmental samples taken during a routine government inspection at its california packing facility. there are no reported illnesses associated with this recall.listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.the recalled products – california-grown conventional and organic avocados -- were packed at henry avocado’s packing facility in california and distributed in arizona, california, florida new hampshire, north carolina and wisconsin. all shipments from the packing facility are subject to the recall (henry avocado did not begin packing there until late january 2019). avocados imported from mexico and distributed by henry avocado are not subject to the recall and may continue to be sold and consumed.henry avocado is contacting all affected customers to confirm that the recalled products are immediately removed from store shelves. for conventional products purchased at retail, consumers can identify the recalled products by the “bravocado” stickers. henry avocado organic products do not carry the “bravocado” label on the sticker. instead those products are labeled “organic” and include “california” on the sticker. retailers can identify henry avocado organic products by the bar code on the stickers.consumers who have purchased any recalled avocados are urged not to consume them, but to discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. consumers with further questions may contact henry avocado at (760) 745-6632, ext 132 or visit www.henryavocado.com/mediahenry avocado corporation is fully cooperating with federal and california health officials to facilitate an efficient and complete recall of these avocados.“we are voluntarily recalling our products and taking every action possible to ensure the safety of consumers who eat our avocados,” says phil henry, president of henry avocado."

388,2019,6,21,us,Keurig Dr Pepper Announces Voluntary Withdrawal of Unflavored Peñafiel Mineral Spring Water that Does Not Meet FDA Bottled Water Quality Standards,"null BURLINGTON, MA and PLANO, TX - Keurig Dr Pepper today announced it will voluntarily withdraw Peñafiel unflavored mineral spring water products, imported from Mexico, due to the presence of violative levels of arsenic. Arsenic when present in the diet at very high levels, well above those detected in recent samples of Peñafiel, is associated with numerous chronic diseases. Water quality tests of Peñafiel samples conducted by an independent laboratory on behalf of Keurig Dr Pepper detected arsenic at levels that exceeded the FD!’s bottled water standards for mineral water of 10 ppb. All unflavored Peñafiel mineral spring water products including 600mL and 1.5L of all date codes are included in this voluntary withdrawal. The product is packaged in PET bottle formats. Consumers who have this product in their possession can return it to their retailer for a full refund. Peñafiel is a small brand in the U.S. and quantities in the marketplace are very limited, given that Keurig Dr Pepper has already begun to withdraw the products from the market. The Company has notified retailers that it will work with them to remove the product from the market. Arsenic is found in nature, including in aquifers that are the source of mineral water and where levels can vary over time. Keurig Dr Pepper has recently installed enhanced filtration systems at its facilities that produce Peñafiel, and the product now being produced is well within regulatory guidelines. No other Keurig Dr Pepper products are impacted by this voluntary removal. For further information, please contact the Keurig Dr Pepper Consumer Care hotline at (800) 696-5891 between the hours of 9:00 am and 8:00 pm EST, Monday through Friday.

Symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

The issue relates to controlling factors to prevent the growth and toxin production of Clostridium Botulinum.

Action taken by the company Pasco Foods Ltd is recalling the above products. Point-of-sale notices will be displayed in all retail stores that are selling these products.

Instead, return them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund. About product recalls and withdrawals If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). The FSA issues Product Withdrawal Information Notices and Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food.

412,2019,11,10,us,Ezzo Sausage Company Recalls Meat Products due to Possible Listeria Contamination,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9, 2019 – Ezzo Sausage Company, a Columbus, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 25,115 pounds of sausage products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The ready-to-eat sausage products were produced on Oct. 29, 2019, Oct. 30, 2019 and Nov. 5, 2019. This spreadsheet contains a list of the products subject to the recall. [View labels(PDF only) The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 1838A” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distribution centers in Indiana and Ohio. The problem was discovered when the firm notified FSIS of a positive sample result for Listeria monocytogenes. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. Consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in distribution centers, restaurants, or institutional refrigerators or freezers. Restaurants and institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Darryl Thompson, V.P Business Development, Ezzo Sausage Company, at (614) 445-8841. Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via Ask USDA from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.

Ltd. is recalling certain Sawmill Bay Shellfish brand Pacific Aquacultured Oysters from the marketplace due to norovirus.

Check to see if you have the recalled product in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. People with norovirus illness usually develop symptoms of gastroenteritis within 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms can start as early as 12 hours after exposure. The illness often begins suddenly. Even after having the illness, you can still become re-infected by norovirus. The main symptoms of norovirus illness are diarrhea, vomiting (children usually experience more vomiting than adults), nausea and stomach cramps. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and fatigue (a general sense of tiredness). Most people feel better within one or two days, with symptoms resolving on their own, and experience no long-term health effects. As with any illness causing diarrhea or vomiting, people who are ill should drink plenty of liquids to replace lost body fluids and prevent dehydration. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and given fluids intravenously.

There is no health risk associated with this product for individuals without an allergy to soy.

No allergic reactions or consumer complaints related to this matter have been reported to date.

490,2021,3,3,us,"Bravo Packing, Inc. Recalls All Performance Dog and Ground Beef Raw Pet Food Because of Possible Salmonella and Listeria Monocytogenes Health Risk to Humans and Animals","Bravo Packing, Inc. of Carneys Point, NJ is recalling all Ground Beef and Performance Dog, a frozen raw pet food because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Salmonella can cause illness in animals eating the products, as well as people who handle contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products, infected animals or any surfaces exposed to these products. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, server headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Healthy people infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis (an infection of the heart muscle), arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms. People who have these symptoms after having contact with this product or an animal that has eaten this product should contact their healthcare providers. Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have decreased appetite, fever and abdominal pain. Pets exposed to contaminated food can be infected without showing symptoms. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian. Infected animals including those without symptoms, can also shed Salmonella through their feces and saliva, spreading pathogens into the home environment and to humans and other animals in the household. No human or animal illnesses have been reported to date. Bravo Packing, Inc. is voluntarily recalling the products after samples of Performance Dog and a sample of Ground Beef were collected during an FDA inspection, tested positive for Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes.

Dole Fresh Vegetables, Inc.,is voluntarily recalling from the market all Dole-branded and private label packaged salads processed at its Bessemer City, NC and its Yuma, AZ production facilities due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes and is also temporarily suspending operations at both facilities to conduct an extensive cleaning and sanitation protocol. Products subject to the voluntary recall are identified by a product lot code beginning with the either the letter “N” or “Y” in the upper right-hand corner of the package (see examples below) and will have a “Best if Used By” date between November 30, 2021, and January 8, 2022. Consumers who still have any of these products in their refrigerators are urged not to consume the product and to discard it immediately. This suspension of operations and recall are being performed voluntarily by Dole out of an abundance of caution, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decision to suspend operations and recall all products from these facilities was made after analyzing the strain of Listeria monocytogenes isolated in a single package of Dole-branded Garden Salad produced in the Bessemer City facility and a single package of shredded iceberg lettuce produced in the Yuma, AZ facility. Both of those items were randomly sampled by the state of Georgia and the state of Michigan, respectively, and were a genetic match with a strain of Listeria monocytogenes which FDA and CDC believe is responsible for sixteen illnesses since 2014. Listing of products subject to each of these recalls is set forth below. Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

539,2022,2,17,us,Abbott Voluntarily Recalls Powder Formulas Manufactured at One Plant,"Abbott (NYSE: ABT) is initiating a proactive, voluntary recall of powder formulas, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare manufactured in Sturgis, Mich., one of the company's manufacturing facilities. The recall does not include any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas. Abbott is voluntarily recalling these products after four consumer complaints related to Cronobacter sakazakii or Salmonella Newport in infants who had consumed powder infant formula manufactured in this facility. Additionally, as part of Abbott's quality processes, we conduct routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and other pathogens in our manufacturing facilities. During testing in our Sturgis, Mich., facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing. Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria, and we continue to test. Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula, including microbiological analysis prior to release. All finished products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella Newport and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released. Additionally, retained samples related to the three complaints for Cronobacter sakazakii tested negative for Cronobacter sakazakii. And the retained sample related to the complaint for Salmonella Newport tested negative for Salmonella Newport. While Abbott's testing of finished product detected no pathogens, we are taking action by recalling the powder formula manufactured in this facility with an expiration of April 1, 2022, or later. No Abbott liquid formulas, powder formulas, or nutrition products from other facilities are impacted by the recall. Cronobacter sakazakii is commonly found in the environment and a variety of areas in the home. It can cause fever, poor feeding, excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms. It's important to follow the instructions for proper preparation, handling and storage of powder formulas. ""We know parents depend on us to provide them with the highest quality nutrition formulas,"" said Joe Manning, executive vice president, nutritional products, Abbott. ""We're taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards, as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents, caregivers and health care professionals."" What Parents and Caregivers Should Do The products under recall have a multidigit number on the bottom of the container starting with the first two digits 22 through 37, contains K8, SH, or Z2 and with an expiration date of April 1, 2022, or after. To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, visit similacrecall.com and type in the code on the bottom of the package, or call +1-800-986-8540 (U.S.) and follow the instructions provided.

551,2022,4,14,hk,CFS continues to follow up on imported chocolate products with possible contamination of Salmonella,"CFS continues to follow up on imported chocolate products with possible contamination of Salmonella The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (April 14) said that subsequent to earlier announcements that some imported chocolate products might have been contaminated with Salmonella, a pathogen, follow-up investigations showed another two affected products have been imported to Hong Kong. The CFS urged the public not to consume the products concerned. The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess them. Details of the products are as follows: Product name: Kinder Überraschung Maxi Rosa 100g XMAS Brand: Kinder Place of origin: Belgium Net weight: 100 grams per pack Best-before date: April 20, 2022 Product name: Kinder Überraschung Maxi Classic 100g XMAS Brand: Kinder Place of origin: Belgium Net weight: 100 grams per pack Best-before date: April 20, 2022 A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned batches of chocolate products are suspected to be contaminated with Salmonella and have been imported into Hong Kong. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers for follow-up."" The CFS's follow up investigations found that an importer, CIAO International Limited, had imported the affected batches of products. As a precautionary measure, the importer has already stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected products on April 7, and will initiate a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Enquiries about the recall can be made to the importer's hotline at 2755 7777 during office hours. ""Salmonella infection may cause fever and gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The effects on infants, young children, the elderly and persons with a weak immune system could be more severe and may even lead to death,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman urged consumers not to consume the affected products if they have bought any. The latest information of affected products can be found at the CFS's Food Incident Post webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/rc/subject/fi_list.html). The trade should also stop using or selling the products concerned immediately if they possess them.
